# crew-code-review

PR review queue + scheduler for AI agents. Discovers candidate pull requests
across your repos, keeps a DuckDB-backed queue, and reviews each one by handing
an assembled prompt to a pluggable engine (Codex, Claude Code or Grok;
default: Codex). Ships a dashboard
you can expose over Tailscale.

- **Deterministic discovery**: finds New and Refreshed candidate PRs via `gh`
  on its own cadence (`discovery.interval`, with its own `discovery.enabled` switch), never involving the LLM;
  already-approved PRs are skipped, and an author group can take a repo's
  unrostered authors out of discovery entirely (`repos add --unlisted ...`).
- **Eligibility holds**: discovered candidates wait out a **quiet period**
  (`candidates.quiet_period`, default 15m: don't review a PR mid-rebase or
  mid-fix push) and a **re-review cooldown** (`candidates.rereview_cooldown`,
  default 90m: give the author room to respond to the last review). Held PRs
  sit visibly in the queue and are not dispatched until eligible;
  `queue promote` or a manual add bypasses holds. This is what makes a tight
  review cadence cheap: only genuinely actionable work spends tokens.
- **Durable queue**: candidates, positions, and review history (verdict,
  duration, token spend, workspace) in DuckDB, so "we already reviewed this at
  SHA X" survives restarts (that's what powers Refreshed detection).
- **Pluggable review engine**: `codex` (default), `claude` or `grok`: every
  engine lib-agent-harness can run a native agent on. The agent does
  the actual review, posts to GitHub, and reports back what it did. All report
  through the same verdict contract and write the same review log, so switching
  is a one-key config change. The tool assumes only the `gh` CLI plus whichever
  engine CLI you selected; your prompts may direct the agent to use anything
  else you have set up (skills, extra CLIs), but the tool never assumes it.
- **Live review logs**: the engine tees its output into the review workspace,
  so an in-flight review can be watched via `queue log -f` or the dashboard's
  per-review page (and read back after it finishes).
- **Serve + dashboard**: an always-on daemon with a web UI, optionally exposed
  via `--tailscale serve|funnel`. Most config edits (cadence, parallelism,
  usage floors, repos, prompts, engine settings) reload live within ~30s; only
  the loop on/off switches and the listen/Tailscale settings need a restart.
- **Usage floors**: a candidate is held when the engine that would review it
  has less than `<engine>.usage_floor.{5h,1w}_percent` remaining in that
  rate-limit window (default 10), and runs when the window refills. The floor
  is **configured per engine**, because headroom belongs to the account the
  engine bills against: codex running dry says nothing about claude's week,
  and each holds only its own candidates. Nothing pauses globally. A cohort
  can set its own floors under `authors.groups.<name>.usage_floor.<engine>`,
  keyed by engine so moving the cohort between engines does not change how
  much it leaves behind. The dashboard meters every engine side by side so you
  can see whether the one you're not using has more headroom before switching.
- **Per-review spend**: every review records its token count, and its
  API-rate cost where the engine reports one, so a per-review budget can be
  set from your own data rather than guessed.
- **Everything is config**: repos, author groups, thresholds, cadence, prompt, and
  rules all live in `config.json`. No GitHub handles or repos are hardcoded.

## Installation

```bash
brew install shhac/tap/crew-code-review
```

Formerly `agent-code-review`: the `agent-*` prefix marks a tool an agent uses,
and this one runs agents. Upgrading from it means `brew uninstall
agent-code-review`, then moving each XDG dir (`~/.config`, `~/.local/share`,
`~/.local/state`, `~/.cache`) from `agent-code-review` to
`app.paulie.crew-code-review`. The store re-points recorded review workspaces
at the new state dir on its next boot.

### Claude Code / AI agent skill

```bash
npx skills add shhac/agent-skills --skill crew-code-review --global
```

Installs the `crew-code-review` skill globally so Claude Code (and other AI
agents) can discover and use it automatically. It ships from
[`shhac/agent-skills`](https://github.com/shhac/agent-skills) — the whole
family's skills in one repo, so `npx skills update` checks a single source no
matter how many you use. Want several at once? Run `npx skills add
shhac/agent-skills --global` and pick from the list.

### Build from source

Requires Go 1.26+.

```bash
make build      # -> ./crew-code-review
```

### Runtime dependencies

- **`gh`** (GitHub CLI), authenticated. Used for candidate discovery.
- **`duckdb`** CLI: the queue store (`brew install duckdb`; override the binary
  with `CREW_CODE_REVIEW_DUCKDB_PATH`).
- **`codex`** or **`claude`**: the review engine, whichever `review.engine`
  selects (default `codex`). Only the selected one is needed, and it must
  already be authenticated: this tool never handles engine credentials.

Run `crew-code-review doctor` to check all of the above at once. Each of
these otherwise fails only at review time, as an `ERROR` history row whose
cause is buried in the engine transcript; `doctor` exits non-zero on a
blocking failure, and `serve` runs the same checks at boot and logs them.
- Optional: **`tailscale`** for `--tailscale serve|funnel`.

`doctor` and `serve` also name any key in your config that this version does
not read: a typo, or one that moved. Such a key is not an error (reviews run
exactly as they would without it) but it is not in effect either, and nothing
else would say so. `config get` and `config unset` reach these keys, marked
`"known_key": false`; `config set` does not, since writing a key nothing reads
only recreates the problem.

Your config keeps what it holds. The comments `config init` writes, and any
key from a newer release, survive every write — editing one setting will not
strip the rest of the file, and a comment moves next to the key it documents
on the next save. A whole section can go back to its defaults in one command:
`config unset codex.usage_floor` clears both of that engine's floors.

These are the tool's ONLY assumptions. Anything your prompts reference beyond
them (skills, `agent-*` CLIs, team tooling) is your prompts' business; the
tool neither requires nor mentions it.

## Quick start

1. Write the starter config:

   ```bash
   crew-code-review config init
   ```
2. Add the repos to watch and put people in groups:

   ```bash
   crew-code-review repos add your-org/your-repo
   crew-code-review authors set '*' some-handle approver --name "Some Engineer"
   ```
3. Set your prompts and dials, then kick a one-shot run:

   ```bash
   crew-code-review prompts set on-approve "Notify the team per your conventions."
   crew-code-review config set candidates.rereview_cooldown 2h
   crew-code-review run --once
   ```

   Every command group has a `usage` subcommand with full docs and examples
   (`repos usage`, `authors usage`, `prompts usage`, `config usage`, `queue usage`).
4. Or run the daemon with the dashboard on your tailnet:

   ```bash
   crew-code-review serve --http :8330 --tailscale serve
   ```

## Candidate rules

- **NEW**: open, not draft, review requested, never reviewed by anyone, at most
  `candidates.new_max_age_days` old (default 14).
- **REFRESHED**: open, not draft, re-review requested, head SHA differs from the
  SHA we last recorded a review at, at most `candidates.refreshed_max_age_days`
  old (default 21).

In both cases the PR must not be currently approved (it's already unblocked),
and any recorded outcome (review, skip, or error) at the PR's current head
SHA suppresses re-enqueueing until new commits change the SHA.

A queued PR can carry any number of **named holds**, stored on the row as a
`holds` map of name to expiry. It becomes reviewable once every one of them is
past, so holds only ever compose upward: no hold can make a PR eligible sooner
than another already made it. Discovery computes two of them:

- **settling**: the PR was pushed to or edited within
  `candidates.quiet_period` (default 15m). Authors often mark a PR ready and
  then rebase once more or fix the title; every update pushes the bound out.
- **cooldown**: we posted a real review within
  `candidates.rereview_cooldown` (default 90m). The common rhythm is "agent
  requests changes, author fixes finding 1 of 3 and pushes"; without the
  cooldown, that first push would immediately burn a re-review.

A third, **editing**, is set by the dashboard while a PR's author has the
steering editor open (`candidates.steering_hold`, default 5m), so a free
dispatcher slot cannot claim the row out from under them mid-sentence. It is
renewed while the editor is open and capped, so an editor left open cannot
park a PR indefinitely.

Held rows keep their queue position and stay visible (badged, with a
countdown); the dispatcher steps over them rather than stopping at them, so a
held PR never blocks the one behind it. Holds are rewritten per name by
whoever owns them, so a sweep cannot disturb the editing hold and a manual add
clears only discovery's two. A hold already granted is never shortened, so
lowering a dial takes effect on the next hold rather than the standing one.
Set either dial to `0s` to disable it. `queue promote` (or the
dashboard's ▶) clears every hold, floats the PR to the top, and treats it as a
manual add; plain drag-reorder changes only the position and never lifts a
hold. `discovered_at` records the *first* sweep that saw the pending work and
is never bumped by later sweeps.

Candidates are processed FIFO by first discovery (a later sweep can never
leapfrog PRs already waiting; New-before-Refreshed and PR number break ties
within one sweep), up to `schedule.max_parallel` (default 4) at a time. Just
before the engine runs, discovered candidates are re-checked: PRs approved,
closed, or merged while waiting in the queue complete as a precheck SKIPPED
instead of spending a review. Manual adds (`queue add`, dashboard) bypass
that recheck; an explicit request always goes through.

Reviews are dispatched one at a time as slots free rather than in batches: the
moment a review finishes, the next ready candidate is picked up after
`schedule.dispatch_cooldown` (default 5s). Nothing waits for a batch to
drain, so a PR discovered while other reviews are in flight starts as soon as
there is room for it. `schedule.interval` (default 30s) is only the idle poll,
for when a look at the queue found nothing ready: it bounds how long work the
dispatcher cannot be told about waits, which in practice means a `queue add`
from another process or a hold expiring.

There is no global run-lock. Two reviewers can never take the same PR (the
queue claim is a compare-and-swap, store-wide), but `run` and a live daemon do
otherwise work the same queue in parallel.

## Author groups

We are the reviewer. An author belongs to **one group per repo**, and the group
is a complete review policy: what we may do with their PRs, which engine does
it, and what extra instruction the agent gets.

Review level is an ordered ladder:

| level | meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `ignore` | never discovered (a manual `queue add` still reviews them) |
| `comment` | reviewed, never approved |
| `approve` | approvable when the review warrants it |

Groups are defined in config, beside the prompts they carry:

```jsonc
"authors": {
  // Where an author with no roster row lands, per repo. "*" is the fallback.
  "unlisted": { "*": "outsider", "owner/infra": "nobody" },

  "groups": {
    "core":     { "review": "approve", "engine": "claude", "model": "opus", "effort": "high" },
    "outsider": { "review": "comment", "prompt": "State our conventions explicitly." },
    "nobody":   { "review": "ignore" }
  },

  // Narrower than a group: patches fields onto whatever group resolved.
  "overrides": [
    { "handle": "bob", "repos": ["owner/name"], "model": "claude-opus-5", "effort": "medium",
      "prompt": "Open every post with one sentence addressing them as Lizard Elder." }
  ]
}
```

Who is in each group is roster data: it churns and varies per repo, so it
lives in DuckDB rather than config.

```bash
crew-code-review authors set owner/name alice core --name "Alice" --slack-id U01
crew-code-review authors set '*' bob outsider     # that group on every repo
crew-code-review authors ls --repo owner/name     # rows + the policy each resolves to
crew-code-review authors groups                   # the cohorts and what each grants
crew-code-review authors who alice --repo owner/name
crew-code-review authors rm owner/name alice      # back to authors.unlisted
```

Resolution is two steps. First the group: the roster row for this repo, else
the row for `*`, else `authors.unlisted[repo]`, else `authors.unlisted["*"]`.
Then the fields: the group, then every matching override in config order, one
field at a time, where empty inherits and prompt fragments accumulate.

`authors who` prints the layer that decided each field, which is the answer to
"why did that PR get approved / ignored". At review time only this PR's own
resolved policy reaches the engine, never the roster.

Configs written before groups keep working untouched: existing allow-list rows
resolve to the built-in `approver` group, and `allowed_authors_only_repos`
still means what it meant.

## Author scores

Every completed review earns the PR's **author** points:

```
score   = decay^(revision-1) x [ verdict x size + max(verdict,0) x removal ]
size    = a curve over (additions + deletions), peaking at size_points
removal = removal_points_per_100 x max(deletions - additions, 0) / 100
```

Two rewards, because there are two different questions. **Size** asks how
manageable the change was to review. **Removal** asks whether the codebase got
smaller. Keeping them apart is what stopped them fighting: the curve that makes
a tighter solve win is exactly the wrong shape for a deletion, and while
deletions ran through it, removing 2,000 lines earned less than removing 10.

The size curve has two landmarks, both set by the dials rather than found by
trial:

- **`piece_lines`** (50) is where points *per line* peak: the size to aim for
  when splitting a large change into a stack.
- the **peak** (200 changed lines, from `piece_lines` and `size_falloff`) is
  where the size reward per PR peaks, before verdict and revision decay.

So a stack of well-sized PRs beats one enormous one, by a lot, and that is
deliberate. What it does *not* do is reward atomising work: the curve is
quadratic near zero: when a whole change is already in that small-size range,
N fragments earn about 1/N of its unrounded size reward. 2,000 lines score 29 shipped whole, 2,000 as forty pieces of 50, and
nothing at all as two thousand one-line pull requests.

| PR | score |
|---|---|
| +100 / -100 | 100 |
| +1000 / -1000 | 29 |
| +100 / -1000 | 227 |
| +1000 / -100 | 47 |
| -2000 | 429 |

Removal is measured NET, so a pure move or rename earns nothing from it: the
review it cost is already paid for by the size reward. The removal component is
split-neutral before rounding when all pieces are net deletions under the same
verdict and revision multiplier. Splitting a balanced replacement into a delete
and an add earns a removal reward the combined PR would not.

At the defaults, deleting more never earns less. That is not guaranteed by
separating the rewards alone: a smaller piece size, larger size reward, steeper
falloff or lower removal rate can make the declining size reward outweigh the
extra removal reward. For example, changing only `piece_lines` to 5 makes a
20-line deletion earn 104 and a 100-line deletion earn 71.

A first-pass approval beats comment rounds followed by approval at the defaults.
A second review at the same commit scores 0: it is discussion, not new work.

The dashboard's Config page draws this curve, prices a hypothetical PR against
it, and lets you tune a whole policy against a map of what every PR shape would
earn before you commit to it. The figures come from the daemon's own scorer, so
a preview is what a review would actually pay.

Which lines count is the repo's own business. Files its `.gitattributes` marks
`linguist-generated` or `linguist-vendored` are left out, honouring git's
rules; `scoring.exclude_paths` is the operator's escape hatch for a repo that
has not marked its own.

**Scores are frozen** when a review completes, stored with a hash of the rules
that produced them. Retuning `scoring.*` therefore changes what future reviews
earn and leaves existing points alone. `score recompute` is the deliberate act
of re-applying today's rules to past reviews; it is offline, re-deriving from
each row's stored measurement, so changing exclusions costs no API calls.
`score refetch` asks GitHub again and is the only repair for a row whose size
was never measured, which needs the PR to still be at the head that was
reviewed. Both refuse to touch all of history without `--all`, both take
`--dry-run`, and a score set by hand survives them unless `--include-manual`.

Turn it off with `scoring.mode`: `enabled`, `leaderboard-only` (stop measuring,
removing the per-review GitHub call, while still showing the points already
earned), or `disabled` (also hides the leaderboard). Per repo under
`scoring.repos`.

## How review works

For each candidate the CLI assembles a prompt (your `review.main_prompt`, a
built-in **approval directive**, your post-outcome instructions, plus every
matching `review.rules` fragment) and hands it to the engine along with a tmp
workspace. The agent performs the review itself, takes all the GitHub actions,
and reports back what it did (`APPROVED`, `COMMENTED`, `REQUESTED_CHANGES`, or
`SKIPPED`) so the queue and history stay accurate. History records the
verdict, how long the review took, and the token spend; the engine tees its
output into the workspace's `agent.log`, watchable live with
`queue log <owner/repo> <n> --follow` or the dashboard's per-review page.

The approval directive is always present and **defaults to comment-only**. An
`APPROVE` is only ever permitted when the author's resolved group is at the
`approve` level **and** it isn't a self-authored PR, never as a fallback when a
rule happens to be missing. The self-review veto sits above the group cascade:
no group and no override can grant approving your own PR. In the comment-only
case the directive gives no reason, so it can't leak who the gh user is.

**Post-outcome instructions** (`review.on_approve`, `review.on_comment`,
`review.on_reject`) tell the agent what to do after landing on each outcome
(reject = requested changes). This is where workspace-specific conventions
live (team channels, emoji rituals, notification tooling); the tool ships
none of that. A group's own `prompt` covers the unconditional per-cohort case;
`review.rules` add further conditional instructions (per group, per handle, per
repo, per candidate type, optionally scoped to one outcome).

Because a group can name its own engine, concurrent reviews can run both. The
usage floor is therefore applied **per engine**: when one is out of headroom
its candidates wait in the queue like any other hold, while candidates bound
for the other engine run as normal.

## Steering a review

A PR's author can leave a short instruction that shapes the next review of
their PR, from the dashboard. The account reviews are posted as can steer any
of them.

```
The migration is behind a flag, so focus on:

- the rollback path
- the `down` migration
```

Markdown is preserved and reaches the reviewer as written. It renders last in
the prompt, inside markers the author cannot predict, under a framing that
names who wrote it
and states that it cannot change the approval policy, widen what the reviewer
may do, or ask it to skip the review. Steering from the PR author is presented
as an interested party's context; steering from the reviewing account is
presented as the operator's guidance.

Steering lives as long as the queue row: it is dropped when the review
completes, and survives when new commits land mid-review, because the
instruction still applies to the re-review.

### Who may steer

The dashboard has no login of its own. `--tailscale serve` authenticates the
viewer and asserts their identity in a header, and the roster maps that to a
GitHub handle:

```
crew-code-review authors set '*' octocat approver --tailscale-login octo@example.com
```

Without a `tailscale_login` a person can browse and steer nothing. The
identity chip at the bottom of the sidebar always shows who the dashboard
thinks you are, which is the first thing to check when steering is refused.

Because a manual add is usually claimed by a free reviewer within one idle
poll, the queue form has a second button that sets steering as part of the
add rather than after it.

## Configuration

`~/.config/app.paulie.crew-code-review/config.json` (respects `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`). See
`config.example.json` for the full shape: `repos`, `gh_user`, `candidates`,
`schedule`, `review` (engine + prompt + rules + codex/claude/grok), `authors`
(groups + unlisted + overrides), `store`, and `dashboard` (addr + tailscale).
Group *membership* is **not** in config; it lives in the store; manage it with
`authors set`.

## Dashboard

`serve` hosts a small web UI (default `127.0.0.1:8330`):

The bind is loopback on purpose. The dashboard has no login of its own:
reaching it *is* the authorisation, and `--tailscale serve` is what grants
that, proxying from your tailnet to this port. It also attaches the
`Tailscale-User-Login` identity header the roster trusts, stripping any forged
copy on the way through, so a request that reaches the port without going
through the proxy could assert whatever it liked. Bind wider only
deliberately.

- **Queue**: the pending worklist (add via pasted PR URL or
  `owner/repo/pull/N`; live title/author fetched on add, closed/merged PRs
  and unwatched repos rejected; drag-to-reorder; ✕ removal). A reviewing
  badge links to that review's live log page; held rows show an on-hold badge
  with the reason and a countdown, plus a ▶ "review now" action that clears
  the hold (reordering alone never does). Beside it: **engine usage
  meters** (labelled with the engine being metered) (5h + weekly windows, polled every `dashboard.usage_poll_interval`,
  default 10m) with total token spend, a **last-24h chart** of
  approved / commented / changes-requested outcomes per hour, and paginated
  recent runs. Auto-refreshes.
- **History**: every recorded outcome (approvals, comments, change requests,
  skips, errors) with duration, token spend, and a link to each review's log.
- **Leaderboard**: authors ranked by the points their reviewed PRs have
  earned, with the window narrowable. Hidden entirely when `scoring.mode` is
  `disabled`; under `leaderboard-only` it says the standings are paused rather
  than silently ceasing to update.
- **Review log** (`/review/<owner>/<repo>/<n>`): the agent's output as one
  bubble per event (prompt, agent messages, commands with status and
  duration) tailing live while the review runs, with a raw view toggle.
- **Config**: daemon version, watched repos, resolved settings, and the
  allowed-authors list. Read-only.
- **Prompt**: the main prompt, the rules, and a fully assembled preview of
  what the agent receives (allowed vs not-allowed author variants). Read-only.
- **Logs**: a live tail of the daemon's own log.

**Seasonal themes.** `dashboard.theme` adds decorations to the dashboard: `auto` (the
default) switches a set on in its season, which for now means Halloween in October. `none` turns
decorations off, and naming a set (`halloween`) forces it on. They are purely cosmetic and
never block a click. Reduced-motion users get the decorations without the
animation. To preview a set whatever the date, add `?theme=halloween` to the
URL.

Queue add/reorder/promote are also available as JSON endpoints
(`POST /api/queue`, `POST /api/queue/reorder`, `POST /api/queue/promote`). The dashboard has no auth, so keep it on your tailnet
(`--tailscale serve`) unless you mean to expose it.

## Output

NDJSON on stdout, one JSON record per line. `-f json` and `-f yaml` print a
list as one document, `{"data": [...]}`. `run`, `score recompute` and `score
refetch` end with a trailing `{"@summary": {...}}` line (a sibling of `data`
under json/yaml). Errors go to stderr as `{"error", "fixable_by", "hint"}`
with a non-zero exit.

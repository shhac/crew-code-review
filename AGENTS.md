## Key patterns

- **The dashboard bundle is committed, not built in CI.** `make dashboard`
  (npm run build in `internal/dashboard/ui`) writes into
  `internal/dashboard/assets/`, which `go:embed` ships and the release
  workflow embeds as-is via `go build`. After ANY change under `ui/src`,
  run `make dashboard` and commit the regenerated assets; CI's
  `dashboard-fresh` job rebuilds and diffs to enforce this. Release ritual:
  `make release VERSION=vX.Y.Z` (verifies tag availability, clean tree,
  dashboard freshness, Go tests, `go vet`, and frontend tests), then `git tag
  vX.Y.Z` and `git push origin main vX.Y.Z`. Pushing the `v*` tag is the only
  build trigger: the Release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
  cross-builds the CGO-free binaries, publishes the GitHub Release, and updates
  the Homebrew formula. You never cross-compile or upload artifacts by hand;
  locally you only commit the dashboard bundle and push the tag.

- **Author scoring is frozen per review, and the diff is read BEFORE the
  engine runs.** Every completed review earns the PR's author points
  (`internal/score`, pure, no I/O). Two orderings carry the design. First, the
  score is computed once, at completion, and stored with a hash of the ruleset
  that produced it, so retuning a multiplier changes what FUTURE reviews earn
  and nobody loses points they already have; `score recompute` is the
  deliberate act of re-applying new rules to old rows, and it refuses to touch
  all of history without `--all`. Second, the per-file diff fetch happens at
  CLAIM time, not after the verdict. The gap between a verdict and `Complete`
  is microseconds and crash recovery depends on it: put ~31 sequential `gh`
  calls there and a daemon death stops losing a score and starts losing the
  REVIEW, because Reconcile appends an ERROR row, the next claim's recheck sees
  we already reviewed this head on GitHub, and records SKIPPED. Scoring after
  the verdict is therefore pure arithmetic that rides into the same atomic
  history insert.

- **Scoring has three modes, because stopping the work and hiding the results
  are different decisions.** Its only ongoing cost is one GitHub call per
  review to measure the diff, so `leaderboard-only` switches that off while
  still showing the points already earned; `disabled` also hides the page, and
  the nav entry with it. An unrecognised mode reads as ENABLED and is reported
  through doctor rather than silently switching scoring off, which is the
  failure nobody would notice. Routing still matches a hidden page, so
  reaching it by URL explains itself instead of silently redirecting.

- **Review workspaces live in the STATE dir, and are swept.** They used to be
  `os.MkdirTemp("")`, which on macOS is `/var/folders` and gets cleaned by the
  OS: measured on a two-month-old install, 92% of the transcripts history
  pointed at were already gone, so `queue log` and the dashboard's postmortem
  view were empty for almost everything. They are now under
  `xdg.StateDir` (state, not cache: nothing can re-fetch an agent transcript;
  not data: losing one costs a postmortem, not a record), swept at boot against
  `review.workspace_retention`. Owning the location means owning the lifetime,
  and nothing had: the same install held 8,168 directories with no history row
  at all. Rows written before the move keep their dead `/tmp` paths and degrade
  exactly as they already did. Because the location is the user's real state
  dir, the scheduler's tests point every XDG variable at a temp root in their
  `TestMain`: before that, each `go test` created directories there and ran
  the real retention sweep over the user's transcripts.

- **A score is two rewards, because there are two questions.** SIZE asks how
  manageable the change was to review; REMOVAL asks whether the codebase got
  smaller. They were one number until v0.39 and it could not hold both: the
  curve that makes a tighter solve win is exactly the wrong shape for a
  deletion, so while deletions ran through it, removing 2,000 lines earned
  LESS than removing 10, and the dial that fixed one broke the other
  (`deletion_weight` above 1 pushed a big deletion into a worse rate, and
  `shrink_bonus` existed to pay it back). Removal is now
  `removal_points_per_100` x net removed lines / 100, added rather than multiplied,
  so it cannot be dragged around by the size curve. It is NET (a pure move
  earns nothing from it; the review it cost is already paid by size) and
  linear (the removal component is split-neutral before rounding when every
  piece is net-deleting at the same verdict and revision multiplier). Splitting
  a balanced replacement into a deletion PR and an addition PR earns a removal
  reward the combined PR would not. Monotonic deletion scores hold at the
  DEFAULTS, not under every legal tuning: with only `piece_lines` changed to
  5, deleting 20 lines earns 104 but deleting 100 earns 71. The removal rate
  must outweigh the size curve's declining slope to preserve that ordering.

- **The size curve is closed-form, with landmarks, because a hand-drawn ladder
  could draw incoherent shapes.** Five configurable tiers whose multipliers
  were interpolated between anchors could express any curve, and most of the
  curves it could express were wrong in ways nobody could see: cliffs at every
  boundary under `step`, a tail that paid a bigger PR less by accident, a rate
  spread that silently set the farming bound. The machinery that policed all
  that (derived tail anchors, a monotonicity rule, a step-or-ramp mode) existed
  only because the shape was drawn by hand. `size = size_points x norm(k) x
  x^2/(1+x)^k` with `x = changed / (piece_lines x (k-1))` needs none of it, and
  both landmarks fall exactly on the dials: points per LINE peak at
  `piece_lines` (the size to aim for when splitting), the size reward per PR peaks at
  `Peak()` (before verdict and revision decay). The normalisation is DERIVED from
  the falloff rather than hardcoded, or changing the falloff would quietly
  rescale the whole leaderboard.

- **Quadratic near zero is what stops the leaderboard being won by one-line
  PRs.** The v0.38 ruleset made points per line rise without limit as a PR
  shrank, so 2,000 lines as 2,000 one-line PRs earned 104,000 against 57
  shipped whole, and the only defence was a tier configured to pay nothing,
  which nobody would remember to set. In the quadratic region, N fragments of an already small change
  earn about 1/N of its unrounded size reward, while
  a stack of well-sized pieces still wins by a lot (2,000 lines: 29 whole,
  2,000 as forty pieces of 50, 0 as two thousand fragments). That premium is
  the loudest judgment in the policy and `size_falloff` is its dial.

- **The tiers are labels now.** `tiny/small/medium/large/huge` still travel
  with a score because they are what makes a surprising number explain itself,
  but they no longer carry multipliers: their boundaries are multiples of
  `piece_lines` and `Peak()`, so they follow the dials instead of being a
  second set of numbers to keep in step. The Config page draws the curve,
  prices hypothetical PRs against it and surveys whole candidate policies, all
  from the daemon: `/api/config` carries the landmarks, `/api/score/preview`
  calls `score.Compute`, `/api/score/simulate` takes a whole scoring document.
  Every dial is already on the page, so a browser-side version was available
  and would have been a second implementation of the policy; a preview that
  disagrees with the scorer is worse than none, because it is the number people
  plan against.

- **The retired dials are reported, not translated.** `base`, `churn_unit`,
  `churn_exponent`, `deletion_weight`, `shrink_bonus`, `curve` and `buckets`
  are still parsed and still hashed into nothing: `ValidateScoring` names each
  one and what to reach for instead. There is no honest automatic mapping,
  because the old shape could express policies this one deliberately cannot.

- **Two scoring numbers that look arbitrary and are not.**
  `attempt_decay` is validated as strictly under 1, not
  "at most 1": at exactly 1 nothing decays and comment-comment-approve (225)
  outscores a first-pass approval (150), inverting the one ordering the scheme
  exists to enforce. And a PR with nothing to review scores 0 rather than
  falling through to the smallest tier: a PR whose every file is
  `linguist-generated` (a lockfile bump, or this repo's own committed dashboard
  bundle) would otherwise be priced as a tidy little change, scoring more than a
  real +200/-100 PR earns. Each is pinned by a test that demonstrates the
  failure rather than just asserting the value.

- **The leaderboard pays once per REVISION, enforced in the aggregate.** Two
  scored history rows at the same `head_sha` would pay twice for one piece of
  work, and that is reachable with no bug in the scoring at all: a review
  outrunning its claim lease can be re-claimed, and if both workers resolve
  their `ScoreContext` before either writes history, neither sees the other and
  both derive a full score. The `Leaderboard` query keeps the earliest scored
  row per `(repo, number, head_sha)`, which closes it in one place rather than
  trying to win a race between processes that may not share a host.

- **The measurement is stored, so policy is re-appliable offline.**
  `history.diff_files` keeps each changed file's path, counts, and the repo's
  own verdict on it (`linguist-generated`/`vendored`, resolved at review time).
  Metadata only, never patch text, capped at 500 files and absent when the
  listing was truncated. It is the same escape-hatch reasoning as `usage_raw`,
  and it is what lets `exclude_paths` and `use_gitattributes` sit INSIDE the
  ruleset hash: a change to either is a `recompute` that re-runs the policy
  over the stored files with no network at all. They were deliberately outside
  the hash until this existed, because flagging rows that nothing could repair
  would have been worse than not flagging them. A change to the REPO's own
  `.gitattributes` is not covered, and should not be: that is the repo changing
  its mind, not us changing our policy.

- **Historical revisions cannot be re-measured, so there is no backfill.**
  Measured against two weeks of real history: of the reviews whose head had
  moved, 5 in 6 had been REBASED rather than merely added to, and a rebased
  PR's old head is orphaned. GitHub will still serve the commit object by SHA,
  but `compare` 404s on it, because a merge base cannot be computed against a
  commit reachable from no ref, and the odds worsen as unreachable objects are
  collected. A partial backfill is also worse than none: only PRs that were
  never force-pushed would score, which silently ranks people by whether they
  rebase. Scoring therefore starts when it is switched on.

- **`refetch` is the only repair for an unmeasured row, and it needs the head
  to still match.** GitHub serves a pull request's file list only at its
  CURRENT head; measuring an older revision means REST `compare`, which bundles
  patch text nobody wants (measured 581KB against this query's 3KB on the same
  PR). So a row whose PR has moved on stays unscored and says why, rather than
  being credited a diff its review never saw. One pipeline does the measuring
  (`discover.Measurer`), shared by completion and refetch, because a second
  copy of it is exactly what produced the earlier drift.

- **Generated files are the repo's declaration, never our list.** Size
  excludes `linguist-generated` / `linguist-vendored` paths read from the
  repo's own `.gitattributes` (the same declaration that collapses them in
  GitHub's diff view), because we do not know which repos this runs against and
  any list we owned would be wrong for all of them. Linguist's BUILT-IN
  heuristics (it knows `package-lock.json` with no config at all) are Ruby and
  are deliberately not reimplemented; `scoring.exclude_paths` is the operator's
  escape hatch until a repo marks its own files. Git's own rules are honoured
  where it counts: EVERY ancestor directory's file applies (skipping them to
  save a few aliases silently counted files a repo had marked one level down),
  last match wins, and `!attr` undoes an earlier rule rather than leaving it
  standing. POSIX bracket expressions are handled too: `[[:digit:]]` contains a
  `]` that closes the inner `[: :]`, and stopping at it produced an invalid
  regexp and dropped the rule in silence. Per-file stats come from
  GraphQL and never REST: `/pulls/{n}/files` returns the full `patch` per file
  with no field selection, measured at 341,081 bytes against this query's 3,032
  on a 13k-line PR.

- **NULL means unscored, which inverts this table's own convention.** Every
  other numeric column on `history` is `NOT NULL DEFAULT 0` under the rule that
  0 means unknown. Scoring cannot follow it, because 0 is a legitimate score, so
  `score` is nullable and aggregates must treat NULL as absent. Relatedly,
  `history` has no primary key and `ReviewLogKey` is a Go-side digest with no
  SQL form, so a score is written against the natural key
  `(repo, number, reviewed_at)` and the write counts what it matched rather
  than trusting it. That is also why history rows are now written with
  `tsExact` (microseconds) rather than `ts` (seconds): the same truncation that
  made the natural key ambiguous had already been silently breaking the history
  pager's tie-break cursor.

- **One derivation, because two of them had already drifted.**
  `store.DeriveScore` is the ONLY place a review becomes points. There are two
  paths that score one (the scheduler at completion, and `score recompute`
  re-deriving later) and they must agree, which a shared arithmetic helper did
  not achieve: the POLICY around the arithmetic was what diverged. The
  scheduler grew a guard against a head that moved mid-review; recompute did
  not, and since the scheduler leaves exactly those rows unscored WITH their
  diff recorded, they were precisely what `--missing` selected, so the recovery
  path scored them off a diff describing code the review never saw. Both guards
  now live inside the derivation, so neither caller can forget one.

- **Absent evidence is not evidence of absence.** A review whose diff fetch
  failed has zeroed counts, and zeroed counts are churn 0, which is a
  legitimate score of nothing for a PR whose every line is generated. Reading
  the two the same way froze a 0 onto real PRs that had merely been rate
  limited, and because the row then LOOKED scored, `--missing` never came back
  for it: the points were gone for good. `DiffStats.Recorded` (a stamped
  `diff_sha`) separates them, and an unfetched row stays NULL and recoverable.
  There is deliberately no `SetReviewDiff`: repairing such a row means
  re-fetching from GitHub, and the setter without that caller was dead code.

- **Attempts count REVISIONS, not reviews.** A `discussion` re-review is a
  second real verdict at the SAME head, so counting verdicts meant replying to
  the bot cost the author a decay step with no new code written. The index is
  the number of distinct earlier head SHAs with a real verdict, and only the
  first verdict per head pays out; later ones record 0.

- **Family libraries**: `lib-agent-cli` (root scaffolding, XDG paths, creds
  store), `lib-agent-output` (NDJSON contract, `{error, fixable_by, hint}`),
  `lib-agent-mcp/tailscale` (the `--tailscale serve|funnel` wiring). Prefer these
  over hand-rolling; `agent-sql`, `agent-mongo`, and `agent-mcp-host` are the
  sibling references.
- **Go owns the deterministic machinery; the engine owns everything fuzzy.** The
  scheduler/store/discovery are testable Go. The review itself and all
  post-outcome behaviour are expressed as **prompt** (config `review.main_prompt`,
  `on_approve`/`on_comment`/`on_reject`, `review.rules`) handed to the engine,
  never as Go control flow. The tool assumes only the gh CLI plus the selected
  engine's CLI; skills and extra CLIs are user-prompt territory. See
  `design-docs/2026-07-architecture.md`.

- **Harness mechanics live in `lib-agent-harness`.** `review/driver.go` owns
  the verdict schema, reporting instruction, agent-log sink, and bounded
  WORKING-resume policy. One driver (`nativeEngine`) maps each engine's
  application configuration (a `native.Config` plus a request template) into
  `lib-agent-harness/native.Run`, which owns CLI arguments, invocation, resume
  transport, transcript rendering, and usage normalization. Do not reintroduce
  provider protocol parsers here. `lib-agent-harness/process` owns Unix process
  groups and Windows suspended-start job containment. Codex final output files
  are cleared before every invocation, including resume, so a failed turn cannot
  reuse an old verdict. Both engines' processes run IN the review workspace:
  claude has no directory flag, and `codex exec resume` does not take the
  `--cd` a fresh codex run gets, so a resumed codex used to inherit the
  daemon's directory and scope its workspace-write sandbox there. `review.ResolvedDials` is the one
  answer to "which model and effort will run", read by both Provenance and the
  dashboard. Both engines still render the SAME marker transcript,
  with fixtures in `review/testdata/{codex,claude}-transcript.golden` consumed by
  `ui/src/lib/agentlog.test.ts`; regenerate with
  `go test ./internal/review -update-golden`. Use published library versions,
  never committed sibling-directory replace directives.

- **The engine subprocess must leave our process group, or Ctrl-C is not
  graceful.** A terminal delivers SIGINT to the whole FOREGROUND PROCESS
  GROUP, and a child inherits its parent's group, so the first Ctrl-C reached
  the engine directly and killed reviews that were minutes and over a million
  tokens in. The context plumbing was never consulted: the shutdown's
  `scheduler.Stop` contexts (Graceful, Force) are correct, the signal just arrived somewhere else first, and every
  interrupted review recorded ERROR with its spend already gone. Engines are
  therefore started with `Setpgid`, and cancellation kills the negative pid so
  the whole group (engines spawn shells, toolchains, gh) goes with it. Only
  once the engine is out of the terminal's reach does the graceful/force split
  mean anything. Cheap subprocesses (gh, duckdb, version probes) stay in the
  group deliberately: dying on Ctrl-C is the right behaviour for them.

- **Cancellation is checked before the semaphore, not inside the same select.**
  `select` picks uniformly at random among ready cases and a free parallelism
  slot is almost always ready, so leaving "should we start another review" to
  the select alone launched new engine invocations roughly half the time after
  shutdown was requested. A coin flip is not an acceptable answer to a
  question that costs a full review.

- **The positional prompt goes behind a `--` terminator.** `claude`'s
  `--allowedTools` is VARIADIC (`<tools...>`), so it keeps consuming argv until
  the next flag. With the prompt merely appended last it was swallowed as one
  more tool name and every run died on "Input must be provided either through
  stdin or as a prompt argument". It only bit the static permission modes,
  because the fallback tool list is skipped in auto mode and auto is the
  shipped default, so the failure was invisible in normal use. Ordering is not
  the fix: the argv ends with the user's own `claude.args`/`codex.args`, which
  may hold any flag at all. A test asserting "the prompt is last" passes while
  this is broken; the invariant worth pinning is that nothing before the prompt
  can claim it. codex's own flags are all single-value today, but it does have
  a variadic `-i/--image`, so the same hazard applies to anything added there.

- **An interrupted review is recovered, not repeated.** Killing the daemon
  mid-review never loses the PR: the queue row survives (only `Complete`
  retires it), `Reconcile` releases claims held by a dead pid on this host,
  and the lease reclaims anything it cannot judge. What used to be lost was
  the *work*. Reconcile now records the abandoned attempt through
  `AppendHistory` (an insert that deliberately leaves the queue row pending,
  unlike `Complete`), keeping its `work_dir` and so its transcript reachable.
  The re-claim then reads the session id back out of that transcript
  (`review.SessionFromLog`) and hands it to the driver, which opens with a
  resume and the nudge instead of paying for the review again from cold. The
  transcript is the ONLY place a session id survives a daemon death, which is
  why both engines render it into the shared log format rather than keeping it
  in memory. Nothing to resume degrades to a normal fresh review.

- **Not reviewing twice is ours, not GitHub's.** An attempt interrupted after
  it posted recorded nothing. It happened not to double-post only because
  GitHub clears the review request when a requested reviewer submits, which is
  incidental and fails for team requests. The recheck now asks directly:
  `gh` returns `commit.oid` per review, so "have we already reviewed THIS
  revision" is exact. Per revision, not per PR, so new commits stay reviewable;
  manual queue adds bypass the recheck, so a deliberate re-review still works.

- **The two engines report usage with opposite scopes, and it is measured.**
  claude's usage is PER-INVOCATION, so its transcoder sums; codex's
  `turn.completed` carries the SESSION TOTAL every turn, so its transcoder
  replaces. Summing codex (which the old prose-trailer parser did)
  double-counts every resumed run. codex's `input_tokens` also INCLUDES its
  cached reads, where claude reports them apart. These are engine facts, so
  the harness's transcoders state each engine's mapping onto `TokenUsage` and
  nothing here branches on the engine. Both are pinned by tests carrying the
  live measurements that established them.

- **Model prices come from LiteLLM, cached, never vendored.** Only claude
  values its own runs; codex reports no cost anywhere, so its spend has to be
  derived. `internal/pricing` keeps a copy of LiteLLM's price database in the
  app's CACHE dir (`xdg.CacheDir`) rather than its data dir: it is
  re-fetchable, so losing it costs a download rather than a record, and
  nothing bundles the file into the binary. The daemon polls every 6h with a
  conditional GET on the stored ETag, so an unchanged database costs a 304
  with an empty body instead of 1.6MB. A refresh parses before it writes and
  swaps in by rename, so a truncated or reshaped download leaves the last good
  copy intact. Pricing is an enrichment: an absent or stale table costs an
  estimate, never a review, which is why its doctor check is non-blocking.

- **Two spend figures per review, one rule.** `cost_usd` is what the engine
  reported (claude only); `est_cost_usd` is our valuation of the same run's
  token classes at the model's rates. `EffectiveCostUSD` is reported-wins,
  estimate-fills-the-gap, and it is deliberately expressible in SQL
  (`COALESCE(NULLIF(cost_usd, 0), est_cost_usd)`) — the fresh-token heuristic
  it echoes was not, which is how a Go aggregate and a SQL one came to
  disagree by 28x. Estimates are frozen at completion, and the boot backfill
  only ever fills a gap, so today's rates never rewrite what a past review
  cost. We estimate claude too even though it reports: the two figures side by
  side are the only check that our class mapping and rates are right, and the
  metrics summary surfaces that drift. 0 with no estimate means unknown, never
  free — aggregates count priced reviews separately so an inferred total
  cannot pass as a measured one.

- **Token classes are recorded apart because they are priced apart.** A cached
  read costs about a tenth of fresh input and a sixtieth of output, so a
  blended figure cannot be priced. `history` keeps input/output/cache-write/
  cache-read/reasoning plus `fresh_tokens` (the only cross-engine comparable
  figure) and `usage_raw`, the engine's verbatim payload. `usage_raw` is the
  escape hatch: claude reports 5m/1h cache-write tiers priced differently and
  separately-billed server tool calls that are not modelled, so a later
  pricing question is a query rather than a migration and a data gap.

- **The claude engine defaults to auto permission mode, on purpose.** A review
  is open-ended tool work, so enumerating tools up front contradicts "the
  engine owns everything fuzzy". Auto mode routes each action through a
  classifier instead. It is also the better security posture: a PR's diff,
  description, and comments are untrusted input, and the classifier reads user
  messages, tool calls, and CLAUDE.md but NOT tool results, so instructions
  smuggled into a PR cannot talk it into approving an action. Consequences to
  keep in mind: allow rules resolve BEFORE the classifier, so
  `claude.allowed_tools` must stay empty in auto mode or it exempts exactly
  what should be vetted (the static modes fall back to a gh-plus-reads floor
  instead, since they cannot reach gh on their own); auto mode needs Opus
  4.6+, Sonnet 4.6+, or Fable 5, so pinning `claude.model` to haiku breaks
  every review; and under `-p` there is nobody to prompt, so repeated
  classifier blocks abort the run rather than falling back.

- **Usage metering and its floor are both per engine.** `usage.Source` picks the
  engine, and `lib-agent-harness/session.Inspect` reads it through that
  engine's own CLI (codex app-server's `account/rateLimits/read`, claude's
  `get_usage` control request) with the login the CLI already holds, invoking
  no model. `usage` maps only the account-wide windows onto `Snapshot`
  (`five_hour`/`seven_day`, `codex/*` falling back to `default/*`): Inspect
  also reports scoped windows (per-model weekly caps, other codex buckets) that
  overlap them, and one of those near its limit must not park reviews that do
  not spend from it. Each engine is judged against its OWN floor
  (`review.<engine>.usage_floor`, resolved by `ReviewSettings.UsageFloors`):
  headroom is a property of the account the engine bills against, so there is
  no engine-agnostic number to compare against. A cohort may override the
  floors, keyed by engine (`Group.UsageFloor`), and `WithPolicy` patches every
  engine the cohort names rather than only the resolved one -- deliberately
  unlike model and effort, so switching a cohort's engine does not silently
  change how much headroom it leaves. Every path fails open: an errored
  snapshot never pauses reviews, because review availability must not depend
  on the meter working. This tool never reads an engine credential: the
  claude meter used to pull the OAuth token from the keychain to call an
  undocumented endpoint, and moving to the harness removed that code rather
  than hardening it.

  EVERY engine is polled, not just the configured one, so the dashboard can
  show both side by side and an operator can see the engine they are not using
  has headroom before switching. The usage FLOOR still consults only the
  configured engine, since that is the account reviews spend from. A failed
  poll keeps being retried and reports "unavailable: <reason>" in its slot; it
  is never dropped, because a missing slot reads as "this engine does not
  exist". `Snapshot.OK()` is the availability test: a failed poll still stamps
  FetchedAt, so "we tried" and "we have numbers" are different questions.

  Distinct from usage: `history.cost_usd` is per-review spend, recorded from
  the engine's own report (claude's result event; codex reports none, so those
  rows are 0). It is an API-rate valuation, not money charged, which is also
  the unit `claude.max_budget_usd` is compared against, so the Metrics page's
  median and peak are what a budget should be set from. Usage is account
  headroom; cost is what one review consumed.
- **DuckDB via subprocess.** CGO-free so the binary cross-compiles through the
  family release pipeline. Mirrors `agent-sql`'s driver. Requires the `duckdb`
  CLI at runtime.
- **Config reloads live via getters.** Scheduler, discoverer, and dashboard
  hold `func() config.Config` and re-read per dispatch/sweep/request (each
  operation snapshots ONCE and threads the snapshot). The loop on/off
  switches are NOT config: serve resolves config defaults + `--no-*` flags
  once at boot and passes them to `StartGraceful` as explicit parameters, so
  a config edit can't resurrect a loop this boot disabled.
- **Candidacy has three gates, and only one of them is a dial.** Not a draft,
  not already approved, and optionally an outstanding review request. The third
  is `candidates.require_review_request`, and it defaults to FALSE: a PR that
  is open and not a draft is already saying it is ready, and requiring somebody
  to also name a reviewer asks the author to do a second thing before this tool
  will look (on one watched repo that hid 62 of the 100 most recently updated
  open PRs). Set it true where a team does assign reviewers and means something
  by it. The next question it raises is WHOSE request counts, which needs a
  list of handles and teams rather than a toggle; until that exists, true means
  "anyone asked". The other two gates are not dials and must not become them: a
  draft is unfinished whoever asked for a review, and an approved PR is already
  unblocked. Draft is checked FIRST so the recorded reason names what actually
  stopped the PR. `candidacyGate` is shared by discovery's `classify` and the
  scheduler's pre-review recheck (`StillCandidate`), and the knob is threaded
  to both from the same snapshot: if they disagreed, a PR found under one
  setting would be claimed and then immediately skipped under the other.
- **A sweep degrades, it does not stop.** Discovery lists by
  `sort:updated-desc`, never gh's default created-desc: every candidate type is
  a claim about RECENT ACTIVITY (New has an age window, Refreshed a moved SHA,
  Discussion a new comment), so the most-recently-updated N is the right N to
  truncate to. Under created-desc one repo with 528 open PRs hid 12 PRs with
  open review requests behind 100 newer drafts. Three layers then keep one bad
  GitHub moment from becoming a stalled loop, each answering a different
  failure: `runGH` retries a TRANSIENT error (5xx and friends, never a 4xx,
  which answers the same at every attempt); `ghListPRs` answers an EXHAUSTED
  query by halving `--limit` rather than re-asking (300 -> 150 -> 75, floor 25),
  because the 502 means the response was too expensive to build and asking
  again unchanged cannot help; and a per-repo BACKOFF (2m doubling to 30m,
  held on the Discoverer across sweeps) stops a repo that is genuinely down
  from being re-attempted, and re-logged, every cycle. Degradation never
  persists: depth returns to full and backoff clears on the next success. A
  sweep also has a wall-clock budget (default: the discovery interval) and
  resumes at the repo it could not reach, so a slow repo delays its neighbours
  by a cycle instead of starving them. The loop itself has no failure counter
  and no circuit breaker: `loop` logs and ticks on, and `Discover` returns an
  error only when every repo failed AND at least one proved it this cycle
  (repos merely waiting out backoff do not re-prove anything, or one outage
  would error on every subsequent cycle).
- **The daemon log is NDJSON on stderr**, one `{ts, level, msg}` record per
  line through `lib-agent-output`, so it colourises like every other family
  output and stdout stays clean for the records commands emit. The timestamp
  is the point: a log full of "skipping repo this cycle" cannot otherwise
  answer whether discovery stopped or is merely repeating itself. `logSinks`
  carries the info/warn pair together because callers always choose both at
  once (a one-shot run sends both to stderr; the daemon tees both into the
  dashboard's ring). `msg` stays a formatted sentence: every call site is
  Printf-shaped, and named fields are a later change this shape leaves room for.
- **Queue row ⇔ pending work.** Completion moves a candidate into append-only
  history atomically (SHA-gated `Complete`); "reviewing" is derived from a
  claim lease (`ClaimActive`, window `LeaseWindow()`), never stored as a
  status column. Likewise "held" is derived (`Held`) from the row's `holds`
  map of name to expiry: the row is reviewable once every one is past
  (`EffectiveReady` = MAX), so holds compose upward and none can undo
  another's deferral. Discovery owns `cooldown` and `settling`; the dashboard
  owns `editing` while an author has the steering editor open. Writes are per
  NAME, which is what stops one writer disturbing another's hold: a sweep
  rewrites its own two, and a manual add clears those same two rather than the
  map. `Promote` (= review now) is the exception and clears everything, floats
  the row, and escalates to manual; drag-reorder never touches holds or
  source. An always-past instant in the same map (`MarkEditingSince`) dates
  the editing session without deferring anything, which is how renewal is
  capped. Queue order is FIFO by first discovery (`discovered_at` is
  first-seen, never bumped). A pull that finds nothing ready records nothing
  and simply waits out `schedule.interval`.

- **The queue is consumed continuously, not in batches.** One dispatcher pulls
  the queue LIVE and hands the head candidate to a worker whenever a slot is
  free, waiting `schedule.dispatch_cooldown` between hand-offs. Nothing is
  snapshotted, so a PR that becomes ready mid-review starts on the next free
  slot instead of waiting for the batch. There is no global run-lock:
  `store.Claim` is a compare-and-swap, so two reviewers (even in two
  processes) can never take the same PR, and that is the only exclusion the
  design relies on. Two consequences worth knowing: `run` genuinely competes
  with a live daemon rather than no-opping, and `max_parallel` bounds one
  process, not the store. A candidate that fails BEFORE its claim leaves its
  row untouched, so the dispatcher backs it off — without that it would sit
  at the head being re-offered forever, which the batch loop never had to
  care about. The dispatcher waits in exactly one place, watching the
  completion channel and the idle timer together, which is what lets a
  `max_parallel` raise take effect within one idle poll rather than only
  after some review happens to finish.

- **Steering is untrusted input, and the prompt says so.** A PR's author (or
  the account reviews are posted as) can attach a short instruction that
  shapes the next review of that PR. It is the only part of a prompt written
  by somebody other than the operator, so it renders LAST, inside explicit
  `BEGIN/END STEERING <nonce>` markers, under a framing that names the setter's
  ROLE and states what it cannot do. The message reaches the engine verbatim,
  markdown included, because mangling it is not what makes it safe; the markers
  are.

  The nonce is RANDOM per rendered prompt, never stored and never shown. It was
  twice derived from the message with SHA-256, which is the wrong shape at any
  length: the function is public and its input is entirely the author's, so
  they can search offline for a message containing the very marker its own
  digest produces, with unlimited attempts and no feedback. At three bytes one
  fell out in five seconds. Randomness removes the search rather than pricing
  it, so there is deliberately no fallback if the system entropy source
  fails — a fallback would be a predictable marker again.

  Role matters as much as attribution. Steering from the PR author is framed
  as an interested party; steering from the reviewing account is the operator
  and framed as guidance to weigh. Neither can change the approval policy,
  which is configuration rather than conversation.

- **Who may steer is decided in Go, once, from the store.** The dashboard has
  no login: `tailscale serve` authenticates the person and asserts it in a
  header, and `allowed_authors.tailscale_login` maps that to a GitHub handle,
  which is compared against the queued row's author. Three things must hold
  before the header counts, and only the last is Tailscale's: the daemon is
  not serving over Funnel (public traffic Tailscale attaches no identity to),
  the connection arrived on loopback (so it came through the proxy), and
  Tailscale strips any client-supplied copy. The loopback check is the one
  that does not depend on config being right: a wider bind degrades to
  "nobody is identified" rather than "everybody is whoever they say".

  The answer is computed server-side per queue row (`may_steer`) rather than
  in the client, so the rule exists in one language. The author is always read
  from the store; naming a different one in a request grants nothing.

  The roster the dashboard serves (`/api/authors`) follows from the same
  distinction. It never carries `tailscale_login`, the value this whole
  check rests on, which nothing on the page displays; and over Funnel it
  drops email and Slack ID too, since a caller there is anyone on the
  internet. Its rows are an explicit field list, not an embedded
  `store.Author`, so a new store column is private until someone decides
  otherwise.

- **Steering is a queue-row field, not a table.** Same key, same lifetime, one
  per row: as a separate table the 1:1 had to be maintained by hand at every
  site that retires a row, and `Complete` needed an `EXISTS` subquery purely
  to re-derive whether the delete below it was about to fire. A manual add can
  carry steering on the insert, because a freed dispatcher slot claims an
  added row within the idle poll and there is otherwise no window to steer it.
  Discovery re-enqueues every sweep with none attached, so the conflict arms
  KEEP existing steering rather than writing NULL.

- **The scheduler's dependencies are declared, not patched.** `New` takes a
  `Deps` struct: `Store`, `Config` and `Sweeper` are required and everything
  else defaults to its production implementation, so a caller states what it
  cares about and a new seam does not churn every call site. Nothing writes
  a Scheduler field after construction. Single-method dependencies
  (`EngineFactory`, `CandidacyFn`, `LivenessFn`, `UsageFn`, `PriceFn`, the
  clock) are named func types, which is Go's idiomatic shape for one method;
  the interfaces are the ones with a real collaborator behind them,
  `SchedulerStore` and `Sweeper`. There is deliberately no seam that swaps a
  Scheduler method for itself: an object patching its own methods lets a test
  assert the orchestration it supplied rather than the one that ships.

- **The engine is a per-candidate choice, so the usage floor is per engine.**
  A group can name its own engine, model, and effort, so concurrent reviews
  can run both CLIs. Each candidate's policy is resolved ONCE when the
  dispatcher pulls it, alongside the config snapshot it was resolved under,
  and all three travel together on `pending`: the engine build, the headroom
  check, and the prompt must read one answer, never a config that changed
  underneath them. Policy is resolved LAZILY, one candidate at a time until
  one clears its floor, because the dispatcher only ever hands off one and
  resolving the whole queue would cost a DuckDB subprocess per row per pull.
  The floor is an eligibility FILTER: a candidate whose engine is out of
  headroom is never claimed, completed, or recorded, so it waits exactly like
  a cooldown hold and runs when the window refills. That framing is what makes
  it cheap, since the queue already had the vocabulary for "pending but not
  yet actionable". An unbuildable engine is likewise per candidate: one group
  pointing at a broken engine must not stop everyone else's reviews.
- **Every external dependency fails late; diagnose it early.** A missing or
  logged-out engine CLI, an absent duckdb, or a model the permission
  classifier rejects all surface the same way at run time: repeated ERROR
  history rows whose cause sits in the engine transcript. `internal/doctor`
  probes them up front; `serve` runs the same checks at boot and LOGS failures
  rather than refusing to start (the dashboard is still worth serving, and a
  missing CLI may come back). Static config checks that need engine knowledge
  live in `review.Preflight`, not in doctor, so they stay next to the engine
  they describe. The probe set is the REACHABLE engines (the default plus every
  engine a group or override names), not the configured one (a typo in a
  rarely-used group would surface at 3am as an ERROR row) and not every wired
  engine (which would fail a deploy over an engine nothing references);
  Preflight runs per distinct settings combination, because a group's own model
  is exactly what introduces a pairing the base config does not have.

  `ValidateReview` covers the base `review.engine`, which every cohort falls
  back to and which nothing checked: doctor's engine probe already reported an
  unwired name, but only as a failing probe, and the one-shot `review` path
  runs `ConfigProblems` without those probes at all, so there it said nothing.

  A cohort's `usage_floor` is the one engine-name namespace that does NOT
  reach `EngineCommon` through a validated field, so `floorProblems`
  (validate.go) checks its section names and its percentages. Both failures it
  catches are silent and both are money: `EngineCommon` falls back to the
  default engine's block for a name it does not know, so a section spelled
  "Claude" moves codex's floor instead, and `BelowFloor` gates on `floor > 0`,
  so a negative percentage switches the window off rather than being rejected.
  The engine-level keys are bounded by `config set`; a cohort's are hand-edited
  JSON with no CLI, which is why the validator is the only thing standing in
  front of them.

  `config.UnknownKeys` is the one check that reads the FILE rather than the
  parsed `Config`, because the parsed config is exactly the subset that cannot
  see an unknown key. It stays out of `ConfigProblems`, which is a pure
  function of the config it is handed, and reports as its own NON-blocking
  `config-keys` check: reviews run exactly as they would without the key,
  which is the problem, not a broken install.

  The walk itself is `creds.Store.UnknownKeys`, and the writer that stops a
  save destroying those keys is `creds.Store{Overlay: true}` — both in
  lib-agent-cli, because every tool in the family keeping an annotated config
  in that store had the same bug. What stays here is the only part that is
  ours: `renamedKeys`, which turns a key WE retired into a migration hint
  rather than a shrug. It is keyed by the path actually reported, since the
  walk stops at the outermost unknown key and a hint on one of its leaves
  would never fire.

  `config get`/`unset` reach those keys through `libcli.WithDocument`, and
  `libcli.SectionKey` registers a section (`codex.usage_floor`) so a group of
  keys can go back to defaults in one command. Clearing a section goes through
  the struct: deleting it from the document alone would last until the next
  save wrote it back.

- **An author resolves to a group, and the group IS the policy.** An author
  belongs to one group per repo; the group carries the review level (an ordered
  ladder: `ignore` < `comment` < `approve`), the engine/model/effort, and a
  prompt fragment. That ladder replaced two separate switches that were asking
  one question in two places: `allowed_authors_only_repos` decided whether we
  discovered an author's PRs, and the allow-list decided whether we could
  approve them.

  The split is deliberate and load-bearing. Group DEFINITIONS live in config
  beside the prompts and engine dials they carry; MEMBERSHIP lives in the store
  because it churns and varies per repo. Resolution is pure (`config.Config`
  plus one membership row), so it table-tests without a store, and it builds its
  own trace as it goes: a cascade is only as usable as its explanation, which is
  why `authors who` and `prompts preview --explain` ship with the feature rather
  than after it.

  Two invariants sit ABOVE the cascade and no group or override may touch them:
  you cannot approve your own PR, and an unknown group resolves to `comment`
  (still reviewed, never approved on a policy nobody wrote). `ignore` is a
  DISCOVERY filter, not a veto: a manual `queue add` still reviews, matching
  every other gate manual adds already bypass. See
  `design-docs/decisions/2026-08-author-groups.md`.

- **Nothing environment-specific in code.** Repos, prompts, groups, and cadence
  are config; who is IN each group is per-repo runtime data in the store
  (managed via `authors`). Never hardcode a GitHub handle or repo, not in code,
  docs, or the example config.

- **Transient failures are absorbed at their own boundary, not paid for by a
  long timeout.** Each DuckDB statement is a subprocess taking the file lock
  for its ~25ms life, so a concurrent CLI command can land inside a daemon
  poll; `query` retries a lock conflict (and only a lock conflict) a few times
  over ~300ms rather than surfacing DuckDB's raw error. The pre-review
  candidacy recheck is one `gh` call: it releases its claim on failure so a
  network blip costs the dispatcher's backoff instead of the 2h lease window.
  Engine invocations have their own bounded resume policy (`resumableRun`).
  Discovery, usage and pricing need none of this: each runs on a loop and a
  failed pass is simply retried by the next one.

- **Crash/concurrency safety.** Claims are compare-and-swap leases carrying
  host+pid (`Store.Claim` returns whether you won; losing is a clean skip),
  and boot runs `Scheduler.Reconcile` to release claims left by a dead pid on
  this host, so a mid-review crash never blocks that PR for the lease window.
  Run rows are gone with the batch cycle; the claim is the only lock. `serve` binds the dashboard port before starting any
  loop, so a second instance on the same address exits before it can claim
  or review anything.

## Conventions

- **Dev boots: never point a second live _read-write_ instance at the real
  store.** A write-open fights the daemon for the DuckDB file and a review loop
  claims real PRs / spends real tokens. Pick the launch that matches what
  you're testing; no rediscovery needed:
  - **Inspect real data safely** (charts, history, the built/embedded dashboard
    against production data): `make dev ARGS="serve --read-only --http
    127.0.0.1:8399"`. Opens the store read-only (safe _alongside_ the running
    daemon because DuckDB here is subprocess-per-statement), forces both loops
    off, and lets the DB refuse any write. A non-default `--http` port is
    needed since the daemon already holds `:8330`.
  - **Iterate on the frontend** (hot reload, no rebuild): `cd
    internal/dashboard/ui && npm run dev`. Vite serves `ui/src` and proxies
    `/api` to a running daemon (default `127.0.0.1:8330`; target another with
    the `CCR_API` env var, e.g. `CCR_API=http://127.0.0.1:9000 npm run dev`).
    Best loop for UI work: real data, instant reload.
  - **Exercise a loop**: `serve --no-schedule` (dashboard only), then opt into
    `--no-reviews` (discovery only) or a scratch store (`XDG_CONFIG_HOME`/
    `XDG_DATA_HOME` to a temp dir, or `store.path` in a scratch config) before
    enabling reviews.

- `const`/early-return, avoid `as`-style casts (see `CLAUDE.local.md`).
- Tests colocated as `_test.go`. `make test` runs everything; discovery,
  prompt/rules, and config defaults are unit-tested without external deps.
  `make test-integration` adds the DuckDB round-trips and (env-gated) live
  codex/gh paths. `make test-race` runs the scheduler and CLI under the race
  detector, which is what polices `dispatchState` being lock-free; CI runs it
  too, so a data race there fails the build rather than a comment.
- **Test via injection, not subprocesses.** Extract pure cores and table-test
  them; for effectful code, fake the narrow dependency (embed `store.Store`
  in a struct that overrides only the methods under test, so an unexpected
  call panics loudly). Scheduler tests build through `scheduler.Deps` — the
  same door production uses — rather than writing fields after construction;
  the engine arrives as `NewEngine`, the recheck as `StillCandidate`, the
  sweep as `Sweeper`, the clock as `Now`. Discovery fakes its four-method
  `candidateStore`. Review engines are faked through
  `native.Config.RunCommand`, and argv is asserted on what `Review` actually
  sends, never on a parallel builder only tests call.
- Errors: `output.New(msg, output.FixableByAgent|Human|Retry)`.

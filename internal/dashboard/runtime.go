// the reason so an unavailable engine explains itself instead of showing a
// blank meter.
//
// Paused is judged against this engine's BASE floor. A cohort that overrides
// the floor can be held while the panel shows the engine as fine; that hold
// explains itself on the candidate, where it applies, rather than being
// averaged into a panel-wide verdict that is true for nobody.

// Package review runs the actual PR review. The engine is pluggable behind the
// Engine interface: "codex" (the default) drives `codex exec`, "claude" drives
// `claude -p` and "grok" drives `grok --single`, all through lib-agent-harness. The Go side only
// assembles the prompt (main prompt + rule-derived fragments) and hands over
// tool access; the engine owns everything fuzzy: the review itself, the
// comment-only enforcement, and any post-approve Slack steps, all expressed in
// the prompt.

// autoPermissionMode routes each action through Claude Code's classifier
// instead of a static allow-list. It is the default because a review is
// open-ended tool work: the prompt may reach for gh, a language toolchain, or
// any agent-* CLI the user has set up, and enumerating that up front defeats
// the point of expressing review behaviour as prompt.
//
// It also fits the threat model better than a wider allow-list would. A PR's
// diff, description, and comments are untrusted input, and the classifier is
// built for exactly that: it reads user messages, tool calls, and CLAUDE.md,
// but tool RESULTS are stripped, so instructions smuggled into a PR cannot
// talk it into approving an action. A blanket allow rule has no such
// property.

// defaultModel pins the review model rather than inheriting whatever the
// account's session default happens to be, so a review's cost and depth do
// not silently change when that default moves. A full id, not the `opus`
// alias, for the same reason and to match how codex.model is pinned.
//
// It must also stay a model auto mode supports (Opus 4.6+, Sonnet 4.6+, or
// Fable 5), since auto is this engine's default permission mode.
const defaultModel = "claude-opus-5-5"

// defaultEffort is pinned for the same reason as the model, plus one specific
// to this engine: the run reports no effort back, so an unpinned effort is
// also an UNRECORDED one, and history could not tell you which effort
// produced which cost.
//
// medium, which is also Opus 5.5's own default, rather than the xhigh that
// general coding-and-agentic guidance suggests, because review is the workload
// that guidance is least true of: code review holds both precision and recall
// at lower effort, so the extra spend buys little here. If review quality
// slips, this is the first dial to raise.
const defaultEffort = "medium"

// fallbackAllowedTools is the floor a review cannot run without in the
// STATIC modes. acceptEdits and dontAsk cover reads and file writes but NOT
// arbitrary shell, so without an explicit allow rule the run aborts the first
// time the agent reaches for gh. gh is the one CLI this tool assumes, so
// allowing it is part of the engine working at all rather than an
// environment-specific choice.
//
// Deliberately NOT applied in auto mode. Allow rules resolve ahead of the
// classifier, so shipping `Bash(gh *)` there would route the one command that
// can merge, close, and post around the very judgment the mode exists to
// provide. In auto mode the classifier is the mechanism; an empty list is the
// correct default.

// resolveClaude applies every claude default in one place, so the engine that
// RUNS and the preflight that JUDGES agree about what will run.
//
// They did not. Preflight defaulted the permission mode itself and then handed
// the RAW model to claudeAutoModeSupports, which defaulted the model a layer
// down — so the check most worth trusting, the auto-mode/model pairing that
// makes every review fail, was reasoning about a configuration one step
// removed from the one newClaude would build.
